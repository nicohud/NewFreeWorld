# Emmental Project

The goal of the **Emmental Project** is to create a geographical concentration of [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org) citizens in specific regions of legacy states in order to achieve, through exercising their legal right to move freely within the boards of their legacy states, a political majority in alignment with the principles of the DAO. This idea is inspired by the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project).

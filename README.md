# New Free World's team repository


Hi! We are the [New Free World team](https://new-free-world.org). We created [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org), a Decentralized Autonomous Organization running a semi-direct democracy on the blockchain using [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id) as an identity registry. We would like to propose the following roadmap to the community.

# Roadmap Proposal

Version 1.0 / 2022-07-22

We based our proposal on various resources, being [Balaji Srinivasan's new book "The Network State"](https://thenetworkstate.org) one of the best available.
We strongly recommend to read it for those who want to understand the principles, goals and roadmap of [Humanity Unchained DAO (HUD)](https://humanityunchained.org).

### Goal

We define the **New Free World (NFW)** as a world in which human beings can freely choose the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) they live in, and even create new ones.

This means that, in such world, every human being has not only the right but also the ability to opt out from the state he/she was imposed at birth and choose the social contract they want to live in. In the *NFW*, a global liquid market of [network states](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-sentence) (as Balaji describes in his book) that implement *smart social contracts*, has emerged. Thus social contracts compete for citizens' loyalty to survive. This, indirectly, solves a great deal of the long-standing problems of humanity such wars, corruption and poverty.

Our goal is:

> To accelerate the transaction to the New Free World (NFW) by building the first network state, so it can be replicated and improved by others. For that, this state will use [Humanity Unchained DAO (HUD)](https://humanityunchained.org) as the technological tool needed for its development.
>
> We strongly believe we need to achieve the NFW urgently before humanity crosses the *point of no return* that will trap humanity in a technocratic dystopia.


### Implementation

Any organization needs some type of structure to operate. We need a reliable tool that allows us to organize a community of millions of human beings.We propose to use a special type of NFT for the HUD's DAO to democratically assign roles to citizens and create task forces, always based on whatever the criteria the members of the DAO as a whole consider, not only economic-based ones self-imposed by an algorithm. These criteria could be, for example, reputation, trustworthiness, merit, professionalism and commitment to the DAO's goal. We call this type of NFT `emblems`.


The characteristics of `emblems` tokens are:

- Only the DAO can mint, burn and transfer the token.
- Only citizens of the DAO can receive the token.
- The receivers cannot transfer the token to anyone else but they can always refuse it by returning it to the DAO.
- The DAO can take back the token from the holder.

`emblems` can be used to organize the DAO in many ways. To begin with, we propose to mint `emblems` of two types: `guilds` and `projects`.

`Guilds` are groups of citizens who share a common skillset. `Projects` are groups of citizens who share a common task. For example: project `P` may needs 3 *full-time* citizens of guild `G1`, 2 citizens of guild `G2` and 1 citizen of guild `G3`.

Note that a citizen can belong to several `guilds` and `projects` at the same time.

There is a limited number of tokens per `emblem`, as the DAO decides to mint or burn according to its needs at that time. The DAO shall decide wisely on who assign the tokens to, as each `emblem` carries their corresponding duties and responsibilities.

The result of using `emblems` this way is a flat type of structure in which the whole DAO, not a small group of individuals, is fully sovereign to assign or unassign any roles and tasks to any member of the DAO at any time. This can prevent y effectively solve conflicts within the DAO. We foresee the use of `emblems` to grant certain permissions to perform specific tasks on a smart contract level in HUD.


### Guilds

We propose the following guilds to start with:

|Name|Role and responsibilities|
| --- | --- |
|Mods|They are in charge of the moderation of the social channels, such as Telegram, Twitter, etc. They shall answer questions from the community promptly and accurately.|
|Devs|They are responsible for building and mantaining the tech infrastructure, such as smart contracts, dapps, servers, websites, code repositories, ENS, etc. They also play an important role in educating the community in IT security topics.|
|Legals|They are the link between the legacy world and the New Free World. <br /><br />Example: If the DAO wants to own assets available only in the legacy world (e.g. stock, land, etc.), legals should advise on how to make it happen in the best way possible.|
|Medias|They are responsible for all the official communication channels, such as Odysee, Youtube, podcasts, press, etc.<br /><br />Example: Medias shall be in charge of communication strategy.|


### Projects

|Name|Goal and description|
| --- | --- |
|[Genesis Tokens](projects/GenesisTokens/README.md)| A way to commemorate the birth of Humanity Unchained DAO by selling a limited number of tokens on an auction. The value of the tokens will be solely honorific and/or artistic. We propose to allocate part of the funds in the [UBI Burning Vault](http://app.democracy.earth/).|
|[Emmental](projects/Emmental/README.md)|The goal of the **Emmental Project** is to create a geographical concentration of [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org) citizens in specific regions of legacy states in order to achieve, through exercising their legal right to move freely within the boards of their legacy states, a political majority in alignment with the principles of the DAO. This idea is inspired by the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project).|
|[Identity Registry](projects/IdentityRegistry/README.md)| A better identity registry system than [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id) that can better serve for the DAO's goal in terms of governance, scalability and cost. |
|[Staking](projects/Staking/README.md)| HUD token holders would receive reputational tokens that may be used by the DAO as an additional criteria for citizens to opt certain roles or execute certain tasks. |


### Other technical improvements

See HUD's GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/hhh01398/hud/issues). The issue [#16 Support multiple transactions in a single voting](https://github.com/hhh01398/hud/issues/16) is paramount to move forward faster and deploy the smart contracts earlier.


### Schedule

The following is an orientative schedule. Community Calls will be hold on the Telegram groups. Off-chain voting will be done in snapshot.org.

|Event|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Community Call (English)| Friday @ 9PM CET|
|Community Call (Spanish)| Thursday @ 11PM CET|
|Off-chain votings start| Any day|
|Off-chain votings end| Next week's Thursday|
|On-chain voting start| Saturday|
|On-chain voting ends| Monday|

**Note**: Change on the schedule may be announced on short notice, so stay tuned for any updates.


## Calendar

**Note**: The following calendar is an **estimate**. We may be forced to change it on short notice because of diverse reasons such as time constrains.

|Milestone|Estimated Date|Status|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Voting of [#16 Support multiple transactions in a single voting](https://github.com/hhh01398/hud/issues/16) |
|Voting of:<br />- Genesis Token minting<br />- Emblems minting<br />- PoH oracle update<br />- Technical improvements | 08-05 Sat | On-schedule |
